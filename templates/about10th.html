          <h5 class="mb-4">What is the Polytechnic College Predictor?</h5>
          <p>The Polytechnic College Predictor is a tool designed to help students who have completed their 10th standard (SSC) education in Maharashtra to find suitable polytechnic colleges based on their marks, preferences, and reservation category.</p>
          
          <p>Our predictor uses historical cutoff data from DTE Maharashtra's Centralized Admission Process (CAP) to predict your chances of admission to various polytechnic colleges across the state.</p>
          
          <hr class="my-4">
          
          <h5 class="mb-4">How does it work?</h5>
          <p>The predictor works in three simple steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Enter your 10th percentage:</strong> We collect your SSC examination percentage to compare with historical cutoff data.</li>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>Set your preferences:</strong> You choose your preferred college type (Government, Aided, Private), branch, city, and your reservation category.</li>
            <li class="mb-3"><strong>View predictions:</strong> Our AI model analyzes your inputs and historical data to predict which colleges you're likely to get admission to based on previous years' cutoffs.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <hr class="my-4">
          
          <h5 class="mb-4">Data Sources</h5>
          <p>Our predictions are based on historical cutoff data from DTE Maharashtra's CAP rounds for polytechnic admissions. The data includes:</p>
